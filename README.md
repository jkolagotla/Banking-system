# Banking-system

The Banking System Project was developed using Eclipse IDE, utilizing Java Servlets for backend logic and JDK for compiling and executing Java programs. For database management, PostgreSQL was used, with pgAdmin 4 as the graphical interface to manage and query the relational database. The backend efficiently handles customer data, account transactions, and service requests, ensuring secure and seamless processing of banking operations. Integration between the servlets and the database is achieved using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), enabling real-time data operations such as fund transfers, balance updates, and transaction history tracking. This full-stack solution provides a robust foundation for implementing core banking functionalities in a secure and scalable manner.
